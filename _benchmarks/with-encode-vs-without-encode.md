SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=qmdq&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went with my mom to the bank to help her get a loan for a home. Banker runs her credit, and to my shock, her credit score is deplorable for very obvious reasons: I see credit cards on her report that I didn&amp;#39;t know about (my mother doesn&amp;#39;t speak English well, and I handle all her finances). I give her an asinine stare, and tell her to spill the beans.&lt;/p&gt;nn&lt;p&gt;She tells me years ago, a friend of hers, Sarah, asked if she could open credit cards under my mother&amp;#39;s name for her son, Brad. The reason is because Sarah, and her son Brad, both have horrible credit and topped their credit line limits on all their cards. At the time, Brad promised my mother that he&amp;#39;d pay off any new cards that my mom opened for him within a year (that was 6 years ago). My mother, being naive and having a very limited understanding of finances nonchalantly agrees. She opened 2 cards for him, and then he immediately balance transfers his balances on his own cards to my mom&amp;#39;s 2 new cards. Total debt transferred from Brad to my mom was ~10K.&lt;/p&gt;nn&lt;p&gt;We left the bank. I chastised my mother (in a professional way -- she&amp;#39;s still my mother), and I cooled off. I then called Brad. [For the record, he&amp;#39;s a sordid, degenerate, uneducated, pathological liar that clubs, drinks, and does drugs for a living. This isn&amp;#39;t a personal attack on him, but just to give you an idea of the type of person I&amp;#39;m dealing with. His social media accounts corroborate the aforementioned.]&lt;/p&gt;nn&lt;p&gt;He said he doesn&amp;#39;t use the cards, but just makes minimum payments on them. He provided me the login details; he was telling the truth in regards to not using them and making minimum payments. He then promised me to pay them off within several months -- he lied -- because that was 6 months ago. It&amp;#39;s already been 6 years from promise #1, and I&amp;#39;m done being polite. He&amp;#39;s fully utilizing my mothers total available credit, has late payments every so often, thus destroying her credit score and ruining her chances of financing a home. &lt;/p&gt;nn&lt;p&gt;He already acknowledged that the debt was his (in future text message communication), and also made a promising claim, in writing (SMS), to pay off the debt in a certain time frame. I think he has several thousands in assets, but doesn&amp;#39;t want to put that toward paying off CC debt -- especially when it&amp;#39;s not under &amp;quot;his name.&amp;quot; What&amp;#39;s the best course of action(s)?&lt;/p&gt;nn&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: A family &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; took advantage of my mother, opened credit cards under her name, then transferred all his debt over to her. Mom can&amp;#39;t get a home loan because her credit is destroyed. What to do?&lt;/p&gt;nn&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I should&amp;#39;ve mentioned this earlier, the guy drives an Audi R8 -- that&amp;#39;s a 150K car, but I highly doubt it&amp;#39;s his (is their a way to check?). He&amp;#39;s a degenerate who hangs around clubbers and drug dealers who live flashy.  I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;s borrowing it from a dealer who resides out of town and owns estate in my area. Regardless, someone living a fake and empty lifestyle like this has no moral resolve. Nobody with a backbone takes advantage of an old woman who barely speaks english and isn&amp;#39;t financially fluent.&lt;/p&gt;nn&lt;p&gt;Update: As suggested by many, I shared this on &lt;a href=q/r/legaladviceq&gt;/r/legaladvice&lt;/a&gt;.

At the time, Brad promised my mother that hed pay off any new cards that my mom opened for him within a year (that was 6 years ago). My mother, being naive and having a very limited understanding of finances nonchalantly agrees. She opened 2 cards for him, and then he immediately balance transfers his balances on his own cards to my moms 2 new cards. Total debt transferred from Brad to my mom was ~10K.nnWe left the bank. I chastised my mother (in a professional way -- shes still my mother), and I cooled off. I then called Brad. [For the record, hes a sordid, degenerate, uneducated, pathological liar that clubs, drinks, and does drugs for a living. This isnt a personal attack on him, but just to give you an idea of the type of person Im dealing with. His social media accounts corroborate the aforementioned.]nnHe said he doesnt use the cards, but just makes minimum payments on them. He provided me the login details; he was telling the truth in regards to not using them and making minimum payments. He then promised me to pay them off within several months -- he lied -- because that was 6 months ago. Its already been 6 years from promise #1, and Im done being polite. Hes fully utilizing my mothers total available credit, has late payments every so often, thus destroying her credit score and ruining her chances of financing a home. nnHe already acknowledged that the debt was his (in future text message communication), and also made a promising claim, in writing (SMS), to pay off the debt in a certain time frame. I think he has several thousands in assets, but doesnt want to put that toward paying off CC debt -- especially when its not under qhis name.q Whats the best course of action(s)?nnTL;DR: A family qfriendq took advantage of my mother, opened credit cards under her name, then transferred all his debt over to her. Mom cant get a home loan because her credit is destroyed. What to do?nnEDIT: I shouldve mentioned this earlier, the guy drives an Audi R8 -- thats a 150K car, but I highly doubt its his (is their a way to check?). Hes a degenerate who hangs around clubbers and drug dealers who live flashy.  Im sure hes borrowing it from a dealer who resides out of town and owns estate in my area. Regardless, someone living a fake and empty lifestyle like this has no moral resolve. Nobody with a backbone takes advantage of an old woman who barely speaks english and isnt financially fluent.nnUpdate: As suggested by many, I shared this on /r/legaladvice. Please see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ucsjp/just_found_out_that_a_family_friend_has_credit/?st=J6GYNVIV&amp;sh=89f6406f). Would appreciate any lawyers input.nnUpdate 2: Apparently, this made the front page on Reddit. This is my second post on this site, ever. This is an incredibly generous community that really does give weight to big issues facing normal people. Just wanted to say thank you, sincerely, to each and every one of you that has taken time out of their day to put forth their thoughts. Ill keep you updated on this.","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":"Credit","id":"6u9ymt","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"title":"Just found out that a family qfriendq has credit cards under my mothers name.
